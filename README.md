# Voltage-Monitor
This was a 2 person (originally 4 but 2 people left and the project was scaled down) Senior Design project to create a device that monitors the voltage of 16 battery cells using SPI and communicates with a host PC via a serial port. I was primarily software and firmware while my partner was hardware. This is what I created

# Notes
- I used the built in Arduino SPI library
- The final project ended up not working because of issues with our PCB, but we had a breadboard prototype that was functional
